# 8-Piece-Puzzle-Project

C/C++

This AI program is designed to solve an 8 Piece Puzzle that has been shuffled out of order into a random order. I am submitting it on here to further work on it and streamline it down even further, eventually making it as fast as possible and as small as possible. I would like to keep all ideas and edits to see the progress until completion.
